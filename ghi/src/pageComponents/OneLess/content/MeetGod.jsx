          <h1>Hello it&apos;s GOD, Good to Meet You</h1>
          <p className="white">True Story...Years ago, I moved into a neighborhood with my wife and three kids. I was not new to the city, but I was not familiar with the neighborhood and did not know anyone. I suppose it was a two or three days after moving in that the doorbell rang and it was the woman from across the street. She handed me a cake and a note and quickly walked away before I could even get a word out. My wife and I read the note that simply said &quot;welcome to the neighborhood&quot; and then upon my insistence, I threw the cake away. I thought, &quot;Lady, I don&#39;t know you and why do you think I want anything from you let alone eat something from you?&quot; And I had several other &quot;why&quot; questions after that. The root of my position came from a place of distrust and concern of the unknown.</p><p className="pink">This is how many of us approach our relationship with God. We are  skeptical of receiving a free gift from an unknown entity or perhaps, in a moment of emotion, we accept the gift  of salvation only to realize that you have made a lifetime decision to serve a God that you don&#39;t really know or  trust.</p><p className="white">That&#39;s ok, its perfectly human and perfectly normal. God wants you to  know him just as well as he already knows you and the cool part is that it is absolutely possible. Everyone is wired differently but I am pretty sure you fall into one or more of the following categories:</p>
          <ol>
            <p className="purple">NOTE: create links to these 3 items and explain them in the link</p>
            <li className="point pink"><u>I want to know God on an intellectual level, How do I know he really exists? (Rom 1:20/Ps 85:25, archeology, scrolls, everything discovered only proves, nothing refutes)</u></li>
            <li className="point white"><u>I want to know He is the only God, How do I know he is the only way to eternal life? (John 14:6, 2 Kings 19:5,19, Isa 37:16, 1 Tim 2:5, Deut 4:32, way,truth,life scrip)</u></li>
            <li className="point pink"><u>I want to know he can deliver for me, How do I know I can really trust Him with EVERYTHING? (test me scrip)</u></li>
          </ol>
          <p className="white">The Bible reveals the nature of God as a spirit, unity, and trinity. He is a spirit--a personal, infinite being (John 4:24); He is one--one in substnace or nature and incapable of being divided into separate parts (Deut 6:4); and he is three--eternally existing in three coequal persons (Matthew 28:19). While great mystery surrounds God's nature, it is reassuring to know that our God is above us.</p>
          <p className="pink">God's attributes are merely words we use to describe how God is and how he acts toward us. Among these attributes are love, holiness, constancy, justice, truth, eternalness, omnisceince (all-knowing), omnipresence (all-presence), and omnipotence (all-powerful). The fact that we can grasp and understand this much about God is evidence of God's desire that all people may know him.</p>
          <ol className="white">
            <li>Before you make a lifetime decision, you need to get to know who God is</li>
            <li>Before you make a lifetime decision, you need to know why choose God</li>
            <li>Before you make a lifetime decision, you need to know what God will do</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <ul className="pink">Supporting Scriptures
            <li>John 4:24 - God is a spirit</li>
            <li>Deut 6:4, 1 Cor 8:4-6 - There is one God</li>
            <li>Rom 3:10, Rom 3:23 - We are all lost</li>
            <li>Acts 4:12, 2 Pet 3:9, 1 Tim 2:4 - God desires to save all people</li>
            <li>Exodus 34 6-7 - God in his own words</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="white">This is how God knew you before you were born. He wants you to know Him</p>
